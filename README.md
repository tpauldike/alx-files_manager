# Files manager
## About
A project to help me gain practical knowledge on how to create API with Express, authenticate a user, store data in MongoDB, store data temporarily in Redis, and to setup and use a backgroud worker
## Installation
To install and run the app, ensure that you have `NodeJs` installed on the machine or system, as well as the node package manager `npm`

```bash
# Clone the repo
:$ git clone https://github.com/tpauldike/alx-files_manager.git

# Move into the directory
:$ cd alx-files_manager

# Install the packages and dependencies
:$ npm install

# Set up the environment variables (optional)
# Then run the app in watch mode
:$ npm run dev
```

Then go ahead and make request to the endpoints by using a tool that is designed to build HTTP packets and send such requests.
